  A starter template for Gatsby and tor.us direct auth
</h1>

[tor.us](https://docs.tor.us/) - bills itself as "authentication abstracted for the decentralized ecosystem". Give your users a smooth familiar onboarding experience by letting them sign up with google email accounts and other familiar OAuth providers.

Built and designed to be trustless, usersâ€™ identities are not controlled by any central authority, which means that your user owns the keys.

[tor.us documentation](https://docs.tor.us/)

This boilerplate allows you to get tor.us up and running with Gatsby super easily. Just follow these simple steps:

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Set up your Google OAUTH ID**

    First get your new GATSBY_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID by [creating an OAuth 2.0 client ID](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) here, setting 'Authorized redirect URIs' to http://localhost/8000/serviceworker/redirect

2.  **Start developing.**

    [Go to the Torus Developer Group](https://t.me/torusdev)
    And request a custom verifier be set up, giving them your Google client id

3.  **Get the friendly torus folks to set up a custom verifier for you**

    Make a copy of .env.example called .env.development and add the values that you acquired in the first 2 steps above:
    
    GATSBY_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    GATSBY_VERIFIER_NAME

    Now you're ready to go!

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸ’« Deploy

There is a gotcha for building at the Torus library isn't designed for server side rendering, so you need to lazy load all torus components as we have already done for src/components/login.js, otherwise you will get an error saying btoa is undefined or similar.

This should work as is... Lucky you!
